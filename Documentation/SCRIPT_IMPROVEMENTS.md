## Date: October 3, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ Critical Fixes

### 1. **Completed Truncated Code (Line 208)**
   - **Problem**: Script was incomplete - the last line was cut off mid-parameter
   - **Fix**: Completed the parameter name and added full main execution flow
   - **Impact**: Script now runs without syntax errors

### 2. **Added Missing Try-Catch-Finally Block**
   - **Problem**: No error handling or cleanup logic
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling and Graph disconnect in finally block
   - **Impact**: Script properly handles errors and cleans up connections

## üöÄ Major Enhancements

### 1. **Improved Device Retrieval**
   - Added error handling for Graph API calls
   - Added device count feedback at each filtering step
   - Added validation for empty results
   - Simplified paging logic (removed unnecessary do-while loop)

### 2. **Better Date Parsing**
   - Checks both direct property and AdditionalProperties
   - Uses try-catch for robust date parsing instead of TryParse with ref
   - Handles edge cases more gracefully

### 3. **Enhanced Reporting Function**
   - Added try-catch for CSV export with specific error messages
   - Shows device count in success message
   - Displays full absolute path for clarity
   - Better error reporting if write fails

### 4. **Significantly Improved Deletion Function**
   - Shows preview of devices to be deleted (first 10)
   - Displays summary table before deletion
   - Added progress indicators every 10 devices
   - Tracks success/failure counts
   - Better formatted output with ‚úì/‚úó symbols
   - Enhanced deletion summary at the end
   - Warns about irreversible action

### 5. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Added detailed `.EXAMPLE` sections showing common usage patterns
   - Added `.PARAMETER` descriptions for each parameter
   - Added `.NOTES` section with version and date
   - Improved inline comments

### 6. **Better Parameter Validation**
   - Added ValidateScript for ReportPath to check directory exists
   - Added warning if -Force is used without -Delete

### 7. **Improved Main Execution Flow**
   - Added summary statistics (never signed in count, disabled count)
   - Better messaging about next steps
   - Clearer output formatting with blank lines for readability
   - Added "Script completed" message at end

## üìä New Features

1. **Device Count Tracking**: Shows how many devices were filtered at each step
2. **Preview Before Delete**: Shows first 10 devices before deletion for review
3. **Progress Indicators**: Shows progress every 10 devices during deletion
4. **Summary Statistics**: Shows breakdown of device types found
5. **Better Error Logging**: Includes device names and specific error messages
6. **Absolute Path Display**: Shows full path to output files

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Improvements

1. **Stronger Confirmation**: Shows devices to be deleted and requires "DELETE" in all caps
2. **Warning About Irreversibility**: Explicitly warns deletion cannot be undone
3. **Parameter Validation**: Warns about illogical parameter combinations
4. **WhatIf Support**: Fully supports -WhatIf for testing
5. **Graceful Disconnect**: Always disconnects from Graph, even on error

## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Report (No Deletion)
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 90
```

### Include Never-Signed-In Devices
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 180 -IncludeNullSignIn
```

### Delete with Confirmation
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 365 -Delete
```

### Delete Without Confirmation (USE WITH CAUTION!)
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 365 -Delete -Force
```

### Preview What Would Be Deleted
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 180 -Delete -WhatIf
```

### Custom Report Path
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 90 -ReportPath "C:\Reports\stale-devices.csv"
```

### Server Authentication (No Browser)
```powershell
.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 90 -NoBrowser
```

## üéØ Testing Recommendations

Before using in production:

1. **Test with -WhatIf first**: `.\delete-entra-devices.ps1 -DaysInactive 90 -Delete -WhatIf`
2. **Review the CSV report carefully** before running with -Delete
3. **Test on a small batch first**: Start with a high DaysInactive value (e.g., 730 days)
4. **Verify permissions**: Ensure you have Device.ReadWrite.All if using -Delete
5. **Keep backups**: Consider documenting devices before bulk deletion
