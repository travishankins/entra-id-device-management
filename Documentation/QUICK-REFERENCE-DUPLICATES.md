# Quick Reference - Duplicate Device Cleanup

## What Does This Script Do?

Finds devices with the same name that are registered BOTH as:
- **Hybrid joined** (domain-joined, synced from on-prem AD) 
- **Registered** (manually registered)

Then **deletes the "Registered" version** and **keeps the "Hybrid joined" version**.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. First Time - Just Report (Safe!)
```powershell
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1
```
‚úÖ No deletion - just shows what duplicates exist

### 2. Delete Duplicates (With Confirmation)
```powershell
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -Delete
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Will ask you to type "DELETE" before proceeding

### 3. Automated (No Confirmation)
```powershell
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -Delete -Force
```
üö® **DANGER!** Deletes without asking

---

## Common Commands

```powershell
# Preview what would be deleted
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -Delete -WhatIf

# Only delete devices older than 30 days
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -Delete -MinimumDaysOld 30

# Save report to specific location
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -ReportPath "C:\Reports\duplicates.csv"

# For servers without browser
.\delete-duplicate-device.ps1 -NoBrowser
```

---

## What Gets Deleted?

### ‚ùå DELETED (Registered duplicate)
```
Device: DESKTOP-ABC
Trust Type: Azure AD registered
Reason: Duplicate of hybrid joined device
```

### ‚úÖ KEPT (Hybrid joined)
```
Device: DESKTOP-ABC
Trust Type: Azure AD hybrid joined
Reason: Preferred version for domain-joined devices
```

## Safety Checklist

- [ ] Run report-only first (no `-Delete` flag)
- [ ] Review the CSV file carefully
- [ ] Test with `-WhatIf` parameter
- [ ] Consider using `-MinimumDaysOld 30` for safety
- [ ] Type "DELETE" when prompted (double-check!)
- [ ] Review deletion summary after completion

## Trust Types Explained

| Type | What It Means | Keep or Delete? |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **ServerAd** | Hybrid joined (synced from AD) | ‚úÖ **KEEP** |
| **Workplace** | Registered (manual/BYOD) | ‚ùå **DELETE** (if duplicate) |
| **AzureAd** | Cloud-only joined | N/A (not affected) |

---

## Permissions Needed

**Report Only:**
- Device.Read.All

**Deletion:**
- Device.ReadWrite.All

You'll be prompted to consent on first run.

## Troubleshooting

**"No devices found"**
‚Üí Check permissions and tenant connection

**"Failed to connect"**
‚Üí Install module: `Install-Module Microsoft.Graph`

**Deletions fail**
‚Üí Check the error log file for specific reasons

**Too many duplicates found**
‚Üí Use `-MinimumDaysOld` to filter by age first
